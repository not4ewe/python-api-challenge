Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

#### Observable Trends

* Temperatures correlate to Latitude.  Temperatures are higher the closer to the Equator you get.  
* Interestingly, the highest temps seem to be around the +20 Latitude line. This could be because of the randon data set pulled.  However I pulled a random list of cities a few time with the same results.  My initial thought is the +20 parralel is more populated, thus more cities and more temperature readings.   
* There is no correlations for humidity, wind speed or cloudiness with relation to latitude.
